# Web Assignments

These assignments are written so they could work with Flask or Django. Some resources sections may refer only to Flask right now, as that's what they were originally written for.

## Suggested order

* [Web Calculator](web-calculator)
* [Simple Todo List](simple-todo-list)
* [URLy Bird](urly-bird) (needs work, currently Flask-only)
* [Stat Tracker](stat-tracker) (needs work, currently Flask-only)
* [GitHub OAuth](github-oauth)
