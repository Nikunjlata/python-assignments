# TIY Python Assignments

These are sample assignments given in The Iron Yard's Python course. They are 
split into three sections: [basics][], [data][], and [web][].

The basics section is intended to be three weeks of work, and includes 
simulations and charting.

The data section is intended to be two weeks of work, and includes data
analysis and machine learning.

The web section is intended to be two weeks of work.

Actual in-class assignments may differ from these, but these are a good 
starting point.

Note that these are not in any order inside each section. They do build on
each other, but can be done in any order that makes sense.

[data]: data/
